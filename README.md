**Overview**:

Phase 1 lays the groundwork for the project by setting up the development environment, organizing the project structure, implementing core features, conducting basic testing, and creating initial documentation. It establishes the foundation for subsequent phases and ensures a structured approach to project development.

**Overview**:

Phase 2, we enabled user input for API requests and managed state in our React application using the useState hook. The App component was converted to a functional component to facilitate state management. Users can enter an API URL and select the HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). For GET requests, we used the Star Wars API (SWAPI), and for POST, PUT, and DELETE requests, we used JSONPlaceholder, a testing REST API.
